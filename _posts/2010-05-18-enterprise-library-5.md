Available to <a href="http://entlib.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">this address</a> the newest version of the Enterprise Library. Among the updates, the most interesting (imm&ho):

  * Asynchronous data access support 
  * Optimized cache scavenging 
  * Support for the .NET 4.0 Framework and integration with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 
  * Integration with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) validation mechanisms 
  * Major architectural refactoring that provides improved testability and maintainability through full support of the dependency injection style of development 

while other features are:

  * Dependency injection container independence (Unity ships with Enterprise Library, but you can replace it with a container of your choice) 
  * Programmatic configuration support, including a fluent configuration interface and an XSD schema to enable IntelliSense 
  * Redesign of the configuration tool to provide: 
      * A more usable and intuitive look and feel 
      * Extensibility improvements through meta-data driven configuration visualizations that replace the requirement to write design time code 
      * A wizard framework that can help to simplify complex configuration tasks 
  * Data accessors for more intuitive processing of data query results 
  * Honoring validation attributes between Validation Application Block and DataAnnotations 
  * Support for complex configuration scenarios, including additive merge from multiple configuration sources and hierarchical merge 
  * Better performance when logging 
  * A reduction of the number of assemblies 
  * Support for the .NET 4.0 Framework and integration with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 
  * Improvements to Unity
